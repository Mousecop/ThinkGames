<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ThinkGames aims to bring together gamers to have great conversations and laughs! By using real-time chat, you are able to see who is talking all at the same time. This is only the beginning though! I plan to add many more features such as Twitch integration and more chat rooms. So stay tuned for these great features and more.</p>
